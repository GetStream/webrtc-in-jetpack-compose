<h1 align="center">WebRTC in Jetpack Compose</h1></br>

This project demonstrates [WebRTC protocol](https://getstream.io/glossary/webrtc-protocol/) to facilitate real-time video communications with Jetpack Compose.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate below:
- Implementing entire UI elements for real-time video communication with Jetpack Compose.
- Performing real-time communication in background with Kotlin Coroutines.
- Understanding the peer connection based on WebRTC.
- Communicating with a signaling server to exchange peer connection information between clients.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Technical Content

We're preparing to publish a blog post about **WebRTC in Jetpack Compose**. If you need to understand WebRTC and communication protocols, check out the [HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC or WebRTC: Which Communication Protocol is Best For Your App?](https://getstream.io/blog/communication-protocols/).

## üíª How to build the project?

To build this project properly, you should follow the instructions below:

1. Run the [WebRTC backend server](https://github.com/advocacies/webrtc-in-jetpack-compose/tree/main/webrtc-backend).
2. Add the local ip address of your pc on the `local.properties` file on the project (Android Studio) like the below:

```
SIGNALING_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS=ws://192.168.1.123:8080/rtc # You should change 192.168.1.123 to your local ip address, which is running the WebRTC backend server
```
3. Lastly, run the [WebRTC android](https://github.com/advocacies/webrtc-in-jetpack-compose/tree/main/webrtc-android) project on your multiple devices to test peer communication.
